MVVM² (Model-View-View Model squared) is an Angular architectural pattern to develop large applications in easy way. Based on MVVM, this pattern allows you to create large scale enterprise applications while maintaining consistency. Designed specifically for Angular, but can be used anywhere!

Here's some benefits:

* Partially uses Domain Driven Design concepts, business oriented out of the box.
* Separate the UI and business logic of the application, this will make it easier to understand the code and keep it up to date.
* Lightning fast and easy to write unit/integration tests for your Angular application.
* You can migrate your application to MVVM² step by step, which is crucial for large projects.
* A small amount of boilerplate code.
